      title: "Word Order: The Predicate Usually Goes Last",
      body: `## Japanese is built backwards from English — and that's a feature

English is **Subject–Verb–Object**: "I eat sushi."
Japanese is **Subject–Object–Verb**: "I sushi eat."

> 私は寿司を食べます。
>
> *Watashi wa sushi o tabemasu.* — I sushi eat.

The **predicate normally comes at the end**. Everything else — who, what, where, when,
with whom — usually comes before it, each piece tagged by a little word called a
**particle** that says what role it plays.[[note:This is the dependable neutral pattern,
not an inviolable law. Sentence-final particles can follow the predicate, obvious
predicates can be omitted, and conversational afterthoughts sometimes come later.]]

### Particles are the real grammar

Because particles identify each noun's role, **several orders can be grammatical**:

| Sentence | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| *Watashi wa ashita Tokyo e ikimasu.* | I go to Tokyo tomorrow. |
| *Ashita watashi wa Tokyo e ikimasu.* | Tomorrow I go to Tokyo. |

Both are fine. The predicate still normally comes last. English relies heavily on position
to show who did what to whom; Japanese particles make the roles clearer, although order
still changes emphasis and naturalness.[[note:Particles do not make every order equally
natural. Neutral Japanese tends to put context before new or important information, and
moving a phrase can make it contrastive or emphatic.]]

### The two skeleton sentences

Almost everything a tourist says fits one of these two shapes.

**1. A is B** — with *desu*:

> 〜は〜です。 *… wa … desu.*

| Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| *Watashi wa Dan desu.* | I am Dan. |
| *Kore wa nan desu ka.* | What is this? |
| *Toire wa asoko desu.* | The toilet is over there. |
| *Kore wa oishii desu.* | This is delicious. |

**2. Something happens** — with a verb at the end:

> 〜は〜を〜ます。 *… wa … o …masu.*

| Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| *Sushi o tabemasu.* | I('ll) eat sushi. |
| *Eki e ikimasu.* | I('m) go(ing) to the station. |
| *Kore o kaimasu.* | I'll buy this. |

### Leave out everything obvious — especially "I" and "you"

This is the biggest structural difference from English. If context makes it clear,
**Japanese drops it**:

| Full | Natural |
|------|---------|
| *Watashi wa sushi o tabemasu.* | ***Sushi o tabemasu.*** |
| *Anata wa doko e ikimasu ka.* | ***Doko e ikimasu ka.*** |

Sentences with *watashi wa* in every line sound like a language textbook — or like someone
insisting on themselves. Say *watashi wa* only when you're **contrasting**: "*Kare wa
biiru, watashi wa ocha desu*" — he'll have beer, I'll have tea.

**Avoid *anata* ("you") entirely.** It can sound cold or presumptuous. Use the person's
name + *san* (*Tanaka-san wa?*), their role (*sensei*, *o-kyaku-sama*), or just leave it
out — the verb and context carry it.

### Fragments are normal and polite

You do not need full sentences. In a shop, this is complete, natural Japanese:

- *Kore, futatsu.* — Two of these.
- *Eki wa?* — (Where's) the station?
- *Kaado, daijoubu desu ka?* — Is card OK?

A trailing particle with a rising tone does the job of a whole question.

      title: "Particles: Eleven Tags That Do Almost Everything",
      body: `## Particles are the joints of the language

A particle comes **after** the word it tags. Learn these eleven and you can build almost any
basic sentence.

| Particle | Job | Example |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **は** *wa* | topic — "as for…" | *Watashi **wa** Dan desu.* — I'm Dan. |
| **が** *ga* | subject / the new information | *Toire **ga** arimasu.* — There's a toilet. |
| **を** *o* | direct object | *Sushi **o** tabemasu.* — I eat sushi. |
| **に** *ni* | destination, time, location of existence | *Tokyo **ni** ikimasu.* / *Sanji **ni**.* |
| **へ** *e* | direction (toward) | *Eki **e** ikimasu.* — I go to the station. |
| **で** *de* | where an action happens; by means of | *Resutoran **de** tabemasu.* / *Densha **de**.* |
| **の** *no* | possession / linking two nouns | *Watashi **no** kaban* — my bag. |
| **と** *to* | "and" (nouns), "with" | *Sushi **to** biiru.* / *Tomodachi **to**.* |
| **も** *mo* | also, too | *Watashi **mo**.* — Me too. |
| **から / まで** *kara / made* | from / until | *Kyoto **kara** Osaka **made**.* |

### *wa* is written は but pronounced "wa"

The topic particle is written with the kana は (normally read *ha*) but always **pronounced
wa**. Same trick with を (*o*) and へ (*e*). It's the one spelling irregularity worth
knowing.

### *wa* vs *ga* — the famous one

The distinction that eats beginners alive. A working approximation:

- **は *wa*** = "**as for** X, …" — X is the **topic**, already known, the background.
- **が *ga*** = X is the **new**, specific, or emphasised information — the answer.

| Sentence | Feel |
|----------|------|
| *Watashi **wa** Dan desu.* | As for me, I'm Dan. (neutral introduction) |
| *Watashi **ga** Dan desu.* | **I'm** the one who's Dan. (picking me out) |
| *Neko **wa** imasu ka.* | Speaking of cats, are there any? |
| *Neko **ga** imasu.* | There's a cat! (new information) |

Rules of thumb that will serve you for a whole trip:

- A question word takes the particle required by its role: *dare **ga** ikimasu ka* (who
  goes?), *nani **o** tabemasu ka* (what will you eat?), *doko **e** ikimasu ka* (where
  will you go?). When the question word is the subject, it and the answer normally take
  **ga**: *"Dare **ga** ikimasu ka." — "Watashi **ga** ikimasu."*
- Existence and availability take **ga**: *Eigo no menyuu **ga** arimasu ka.*
- Likes, wants and abilities take **ga**: *Sushi **ga** suki desu*, *Nihongo **ga**
  wakarimasu*, *Mizu **ga** hoshii desu*.
- Anything else, default to **wa** and you'll rarely be misunderstood.

### *ni* vs *de* — the other confusable pair

Both can translate as "at/in", but:

- **に *ni*** = a **destination** or a **static location of existence** (with *arimasu /
  imasu*), or a **point in time**.
  *Tokyo **ni** ikimasu* (go to Tokyo) · *Toire wa nikai **ni** arimasu* (the toilet is on
  the 2nd floor) · *Shichiji **ni** ikimasu* (I go at 7).
- **で *de*** = **where an action takes place**, or the **means** used.
  *Resutoran **de** tabemasu* (eat at a restaurant) · *Densha **de** ikimasu* (go by train) ·
  *Nihongo **de** onegai shimasu* (in Japanese, please).

Memory hook: with *de* something **happens**; with *ni* something **is** or is **headed**.

### Time words that skip particles

*Kyou* (today), *ashita* (tomorrow), *kinou* (yesterday), *maiasa* (every morning) take
**no particle**:

> 明日、京都へ行きます。 *Ashita, Kyoto e ikimasu.* — Tomorrow I'm going to Kyoto.

But **clock times and dates take に**: *shichiji **ni***, *getsuyoubi **ni***.

### Sentence-final particles: tone of voice

| Particle | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **か** *ka* | makes a question | *Ikimasu **ka**.* — Are you going? |
| **ね** *ne* | seeking agreement, "isn't it?" | *Oishii desu **ne**.* — Delicious, isn't it? |
| **よ** *yo* | new info for the listener, "I'm telling you" | *Chigaimasu **yo**.* — That's not right, actually. |

*ne* is social glue — it invites the other person in and softens everything. Use it a lot.
*yo* asserts; use it sparingly, since overuse sounds pushy.

      id: "linking-words",
      title: "Linking Ideas: And, Or, But, Because, If",
      body: `## Turn short sentences into a conversation

You can communicate surprisingly well with one idea at a time. Linking words let you add
an alternative, explain a reason, or say what happens under a condition. Japanese divides
this work differently from English: the connector often changes depending on whether you
are joining **nouns** or whole **sentences**.

### Adding things: *to*, *ya*, *soshite*, *sorekara*

Use **と *to*** between nouns for a complete list — English “and”:

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| コーヒーとお茶をください | *Koohii to ocha o kudasai* | Coffee and tea, please |
| 京都と大阪へ行きます | *Kyoto to Osaka e ikimasu* | I’m going to Kyoto and Osaka |

Use **や *ya*** when you are giving examples rather than the whole list: *sushi ya tempura*
means “sushi, tempura, **and things like that**.” For complete thoughts, use **そして
*soshite*** (“and”) or **それから *sorekara*** (“and then”):

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 京都へ行きました。そして、奈良へ行きました | *Kyoto e ikimashita. Soshite, Nara e ikimashita* | I went to Kyoto. And I went to Nara. |
| 朝ご飯を食べます。それから、出かけます | *Asagohan o tabemasu. Sorekara, dekakemasu* | I eat breakfast. Then I go out. |

> **Do not use *to* to join two sentences.** It joins nouns. When actions form one
> sequence, Japanese normally uses the te-form; the verb-form lesson above teaches that pattern.

### Choosing: *ka* and *soretomo*

Between nouns, **か *ka*** means “or”:

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| コーヒーかお茶をください | *Koohii ka ocha o kudasai* | Coffee or tea, please |
| 電車かバスで行きます | *Densha ka basu de ikimasu* | I’ll go by train or bus |

In a question that offers two full alternatives, use **それとも *soretomo***:

> 店で食べますか。それとも、持ち帰りますか。
>
> *Mise de tabemasu ka. Soretomo, mochikaerimasu ka.* — Will you eat here, or take it
> away?

Staff often shorten this to *Koohii desu ka, ocha desu ka* — literally “Is it coffee? Is
it tea?” **または *matawa*** also means “or,” but it is more common in forms, signs, and
formal announcements than in everyday conversation.

### Contrast: *demo*, *ga*, and *kedo*

The safest beginner “but” is **でも *demo*** at the start of a new sentence:

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 行きたいです。でも、時間がありません | *Ikitai desu. Demo, jikan ga arimasen* | I want to go, but I don’t have time |
| おいしいです。でも、高いです | *Oishii desu. Demo, takai desu* | It’s delicious, but expensive |

To connect the ideas in one sentence, add **が *ga*** after a polite clause: *Ikitai desu
ga, jikan ga arimasen.* In conversation, **けど *kedo*** does the same job and sounds less
formal: *Ikitai desu kedo…* Trailing off after *kedo* is also a gentle way to imply a
problem or refusal without stating it bluntly.

### Reasons and results: *kara*, *node*, *dakara*

Put **から *kara*** after the reason. The result can follow, or it can be obvious and left
unsaid:

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 雨ですから、行きません | *Ame desu kara, ikimasen* | Because it’s raining, I won’t go |
| 分かりませんから、英語でお願いします | *Wakarimasen kara, eigo de onegai shimasu* | Because I don’t understand, English please |

**ので *node*** also means “because” and usually sounds softer and less forceful. **だから
*dakara*** begins with the result: *Ame desu. Dakara, ikimasen* — “It’s raining.
Therefore, I won’t go.”

English often starts with “because”; Japanese commonly gives the situation first and lets
the conclusion arrive last. That matches the language’s general build-toward-the-end
rhythm.

### If–then: the practical *-tara* pattern

Japanese does not need a separate word for “then.” The ending **〜たら *-tara*** marks the
condition; the next clause is what happens if it is met:

> もし安かったら、買います。
>
> *Moshi yasukattara, kaimasu.* — If it’s cheap, I’ll buy it.

**もし *moshi*** announces “if,” but it is optional — *-tara* already carries the meaning.
The verb-form lessons above make these high-value chunks easier to build yourself:

| Condition | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| *yasukattara* | if it is cheap |
| *daijoubu dattara* | if it is OK |
| *jikan ga attara* | if there is time / if you have time |
| *ame dattara* | if it rains / if it is rainy |
| *wakaranakattara* | if you don’t understand |

Useful travel examples:

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 時間があったら、行きます | *Jikan ga attara, ikimasu* | If I have time, I’ll go |
| 分からなかったら、聞いてください | *Wakaranakattara, kiite kudasai* | If you don’t understand, please ask |
| だめだったら、別のホテルを探します | *Dame dattara, betsu no hoteru o sagashimasu* | If it’s no good, I’ll look for another hotel |

There are other conditional forms — *to* for automatic results, *nara* for “if that’s the
case,” and *-ba* for general conditions — but ***-tara* is the best all-purpose choice**
for plans, possibilities, and tourist situations.

### “Else” and “otherwise”

Japanese usually states the second condition rather than inserting one fixed “else” word:

> 安かったら、買います。高かったら、買いません。
>
> *Yasukattara, kaimasu. Takakattara, kaimasen.* — If it’s cheap, I’ll buy it; if it’s
> expensive, I won’t.

**そうでなければ *sou de nakereba*** means “if not / otherwise,” but it sounds more
formal. In ordinary speech, two parallel *-tara* conditions are often clearer.

### The pocket set

| Job | Best first choice |
|-----|-------------------|
| and (nouns) | *to* |
| and things like… | *ya* |
| and / and then (sentences) | *soshite / sorekara* |
| or (nouns) | *ka* |
| or (a question with alternatives) | *soretomo* |
| but | *demo* |
| because | *kara* |
| therefore | *dakara* |
| if | *-tara* (optional *moshi*) |

      body: `## Questions are almost free: just add か

There is **no word order change**, no "do/does", no inversion. Take any polite sentence and
put **か** *ka* at the end.

| Statement | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| *Ikimasu.* — I go. | *Ikimasu **ka**.* — Do you go? |
| *Kore wa sushi desu.* — This is sushi. | *Kore wa sushi desu **ka**.* — Is this sushi? |
| *Eigo ga dekimasu.* — You can speak English. | *Eigo ga dekimasu **ka**.* — Can you speak English? |

Because *ka* already marks the question, Japanese doesn't need a rising tone (though people
often use one anyway). In casual speech *ka* is dropped and the pitch rises instead:
*"Iku?"*

### The question words

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 何 | *nani / nan* | what |
| 誰 | *dare* | who |
| どこ | *doko* | where |
| いつ | *itsu* | when |
| いくら | *ikura* | how much (money) |
| いくつ | *ikutsu* | how many |
| どう | *dou* | how / in what way |
| どうして / なぜ | *doushite / naze* | why |
| どれ / どちら | *dore / dochira* | which one / which of two |
| どんな | *donna* | what kind of |

*nani* becomes *nan* before *desu* and counters: *nan desu ka* (what is it?), *nanji*
(what time), *nannin* (how many people).

### The question word replaces the answer, in place

English moves the question word to the front ("**Where** are you going?"). Japanese leaves
it exactly where the answer would sit:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| *Doko e ikimasu ka.* | *Kyoto e ikimasu.* |
| *Nani o tabemasu ka.* | *Sushi o tabemasu.* |
| *Ikura desu ka.* | *Sanzen-en desu.* |

Slot the question word into the answer's position and add *ka*. That's the whole system.

### The tourist's ten questions

| Japanese | Romaji | Meaning |
|----------|--------|---------|
| これは何ですか | *Kore wa nan desu ka* | What is this? |
| いくらですか | *Ikura desu ka* | How much? |
| トイレはどこですか | *Toire wa doko desu ka* | Where's the toilet? |
| 何時ですか | *Nanji desu ka* | What time is it? |
| 何時からですか | *Nanji kara desu ka* | From what time (does it open)? |
| 〜がありますか | *… ga arimasu ka* | Do you have …? |
| 〜はありますか | *… wa arimasu ka* | Is there a …? |
| 写真を撮ってもいいですか | *Shashin o totte mo ii desu ka* | May I take a photo? |
| カードで払えますか | *Kaado de haraemasu ka* | Can I pay by card? |
| これは何が入っていますか | *Kore wa nani ga haitte imasu ka* | What's in this? |

### Answering yes/no is a trap

*Hai* does **not** simply mean "yes". It means "**that's right / what you said is
correct**". With a **negative** question, the two languages flip:

> 「行かないんですか。」 *"Ikanai n desu ka."* — "You're not going?"
>
> 「はい、行きません。」 *"Hai, ikimasen."* — literally "That's right, I'm not going."

In English you'd say "No, I'm not." In Japanese, *hai* confirms the questioner's framing.
This is a real source of confusion — when it matters, **repeat the verb** instead of relying
on *hai / iie*: *"Ikimasen"* or *"Ikimasu."*

### Softer than *iie*

A flat *iie* ("no") is quite direct. Everyday alternatives:

| Phrase | Use |
|--------|-----|
| *Chigaimasu* | "That's different" — correcting a fact |
| *Daijoubu desu* | "I'm fine" — declining an offer |
| *Kekkou desu* | "No thank you" — politely declining (a bag, a refill) |
| *Chotto…* | "Uhh…" — soft refusal |

          answer: 1,
          explanation: `*Nanji **kara** desu ka* — "from what time is it?" — is the idiomatic way to ask opening time. *Nanji desu ka* just asks the current time; *itsu* asks "when" in general; *ikura* asks the price. The closing time is *nanji **made** desu ka*.`

          answer: `Say the **verb**, not just *hai/iie*: **「使えません」** *"Tsukaemasen"* — "I can't use it."

The trap: *"Hai"* here means "that's right — I can't", the opposite of what an English speaker's "yes" would imply. Because *hai* confirms the **questioner's framing** rather than the fact, negative questions invert between the two languages. Repeating the verb removes all doubt.`

      title: "Pointing at Things and Saying What Exists",
      body: `## Two toolkits that punch far above their weight

As a tourist you spend a lot of time (a) pointing at things and (b) asking whether something
exists nearby. Japanese has clean, tiny systems for both.

### The ko-so-a-do words

Japanese splits "this/that" three ways by distance, and every set follows the same
**ko- / so- / a- / do-** pattern:

| | near me (ko-) | near you (so-) | over there (a-) | question (do-) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **thing** | *kore* (this) | *sore* (that) | *are* (that over there) | *dore* (which) |
| **+ noun** | *kono hito* (this person) | *sono* | *ano* | *dono* |
| **place** | *koko* (here) | *soko* (there) | *asoko* (over there) | *doko* (where) |
| **direction / polite "which"** | *kochira* | *sochira* | *achira* | *dochira* |
| **kind of** | *konna* | *sonna* | *anna* | *donna* |

Two rules that matter:

1. ***kore* stands alone; *kono* needs a noun.** *Kore o kudasai* (this one, please) but
   *Kono kaban o kudasai* (this bag, please). Mixing them (*"kono o kudasai"*) is the
   classic beginner error.
2. **The *so-* series means "near the listener"**, not "medium distance". On the phone,
   whatever is on their end is *sore/soko*.

*kochira* / *sochira* / *achira* are the polite forms — staff will use them constantly
("*kochira e douzo*" = this way please; "*kochira wa…*" = this here is…).

### *Arimasu* and *imasu* — the two "there is"

Japanese picks the verb by whether the thing is **alive**:

| Verb | Used for | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **あります** *arimasu* | objects, plants, facilities, abstract things | *Toire ga arimasu.* — There's a toilet. |
| **います** *imasu* | people and animals | *Neko ga imasu.* — There's a cat. |

Plants and vehicles count as inanimate (*basu ga arimasu*) — though a bus **with a driver
you're waiting for** can be *imasu* if you're thinking of the people. Don't over-think it;
picking the wrong one is a mild, easily-understood slip.

Both also mean "**to have**": *Kodomo ga imasu* (I have children), *Yoyaku ga arimasu*
(I have a reservation).

### Location patterns you'll use daily

> 〜は〜にあります。 *… wa … ni arimasu.* — "X is at Y."

| Japanese | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| *Toire wa doko ni arimasu ka.* | Where is the toilet? |
| *Toire wa nikai ni arimasu.* | The toilet is on the 2nd floor. |
| *Konbini wa eki no chikaku ni arimasu.* | The convenience store is near the station. |

Everyday tourist shortcut: drop the *ni arimasu* and just say **"Toire wa doko desu ka"** —
shorter and equally correct.

### Position words

These attach with **の** *no*: *… no ue* (on top of …), *… no shita* (under), *… no naka*
(inside), *… no soto* (outside), *… no mae* (in front of), *… no ushiro* (behind),
*… no tonari* (next to), *… no chikaku* (near), *… no aida* (between).

> 駅の前にあります。 *Eki no mae ni arimasu.* — It's in front of the station.

### Asking whether they have something

The single most useful shopping question:

> 〜はありますか。 *… wa arimasu ka.* — "Do you have …?"

*Eigo no menyuu wa arimasu ka* (English menu?) · *Beji no ryouri wa arimasu ka* (vegetarian
food?) · *Waifai wa arimasu ka* (Wi-Fi?) · *Motto ookii saizu wa arimasu ka* (a bigger
size?)

If the answer is **ありません** *arimasen*, they don't have it. If it's **ございます**
*gozaimasu*, that's the ultra-polite form of *arimasu* — they do.
