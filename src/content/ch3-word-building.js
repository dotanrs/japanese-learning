      body: `## Words are made of predictable, reusable blocks

Japanese vocabulary looks impenetrable until you notice that the same small pieces recur
everywhere. Once you can spot them, you can guess dozens of words you have never heard.

### Three layers of vocabulary

| Layer | Origin | Feel | Examples |
|-------|--------|------|----------|
| **Native (*wago*)** | Old Japanese | everyday, warm | *mizu* (water), *taberu* (eat), *ookii* (big) |
| **Sino-Japanese (*kango*)** | Borrowed from Chinese | formal, compact, official | *suidou* (water supply), *shokuji* (a meal), *daigaku* (university) |
| **Foreign (*gairaigo*)** | Mostly English | modern, technical, commercial | *hoteru*, *takushii*, *koohii*, *chekku-in* |

Signs and announcements lean on the Sino layer; conversation leans on the native layer;
anything invented in the last century is usually the foreign layer. As a visitor, **the
foreign layer is free vocabulary** — you already know it, you just need the Japanese
pronunciation of it.

### Suffixes that build whole word families

| Suffix | Meaning | Examples |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **〜屋** *-ya* | shop / seller of | *pan-ya* (bakery), *hana-ya* (florist), *sakana-ya* (fishmonger) |
| **〜人** *-jin* | person of a country | *nihon-jin*, *amerika-jin*, *igirisu-jin* |
| **〜語** *-go* | language | *nihon-go*, *ei-go*, *chuugoku-go* |
| **〜駅** *-eki* | station | *Tokyo-eki*, *Kyoto-eki* |
| **〜円** *-en* | yen | *sen-en* (¥1000), *goman-en* (¥50,000) |
| **〜さん** *-san* | Mr/Ms (any gender) | *Tanaka-san*, *o-kyaku-san* (customer) |
| **〜中** *-chuu* | in the middle of | *kouji-chuu* (under construction), *shiyou-chuu* (in use / occupied) |
| **〜口** *-guchi* | entrance / exit | *higashi-guchi* (east exit), *iri-guchi* (entrance), *de-guchi* (exit) |

Learn *higashi / nishi / minami / kita* (east/west/south/north) plus *-guchi* and you can
navigate any Japanese station exit.

### Prefixes worth knowing

- **お〜 / ご〜** *o- / go-* — politeness: *o-mizu*, *o-kane*, *go-chuumon*.
- **大〜** *dai-/oo-* — big: *daigaku* (big-learning = university), *ooame* (heavy rain).
- **小〜** *ko-/shou-* — small: *kozutsumi* (parcel), *shougakkou* (elementary school).
- **不〜** *fu-* — un-/not: *fuben* (inconvenient), *fuanzen* (unsafe).
- **新〜** *shin-* — new: *Shin-Osaka*, *shinkansen* (new-trunk-line = bullet train).

### Compounds: two nouns glued together

Japanese builds new words by simply stacking nouns, exactly like English "toothbrush":

*denwa* (telephone) + *bangou* (number) = **denwa-bangou** (phone number)
*basu* + *tei* (stop) = **basu-tei** (bus stop)
*ryokou* (travel) + *sha* (company) = **ryokou-gaisha** (travel agency)

Notice *sha* → *gaisha*: when two words join, the second often **voices** its first
consonant (h→b/p, k→g, s→z, t→d). *hito* → *-bito*, *kami* → *-gami*, *hana* → *-bana*. You
don't need to produce this; recognising it stops you thinking you've met a new word.

### *suru* turns nouns into verbs

**する** *suru* ("to do") attaches to nouns — mostly Sino-Japanese and loanwords — to make
verbs. This is the most productive verb-making machine in the language:

| Noun | + suru | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| *benkyou* (study) | *benkyou suru* | to study |
| *ryokou* (travel) | *ryokou suru* | to travel |
| *yoyaku* (reservation) | *yoyaku suru* | to reserve |
| *chekku-in* | *chekku-in suru* | to check in |
| *kyanseru* | *kyanseru suru* | to cancel |

Polite form: **shimasu**. So *"Yoyaku shimashita"* = "I made a reservation";
*"Kyanseru shitai desu"* = "I want to cancel".

This means **any borrowed English noun can become a verb**: *koushin suru*, *saabu suru*,
*kopii suru*. If you're stuck for a verb, try the English noun + *shimasu* — it works
surprisingly often.

      id: "adjectives",
      title: "Adjectives: Two Kinds, and One Behaves Like a Verb",
      body: `## Japanese has two adjective types, and they conjugate differently

This surprises English speakers: one type of Japanese adjective **carries tense itself**,
like a verb. There's no "was" separate from the adjective — the adjective changes shape.

### Type 1: *i*-adjectives (end in -い)

*takai* (expensive), *yasui* (cheap), *oishii* (delicious), *atsui* (hot), *samui* (cold),
*ookii* (big), *chiisai* (small), *atarashii* (new), *furui* (old), *tanoshii* (fun),
*isogashii* (busy), *muzukashii* (difficult), *chikai* (near), *tooi* (far).

| Form | Rule | Example (*takai*) |
|------|------|-------------------|
| Present | as-is + *desu* | *takai desu* — it's expensive |
| Negative | -i → **-kunai** | *takakunai desu* — it's not expensive |
| Past | -i → **-katta** | *takakatta desu* — it was expensive |
| Past negative | -i → **-kunakatta** | *takakunakatta desu* — it wasn't expensive |

Note: *desu* here adds **politeness only** — it does not carry the tense. Saying
*"takai deshita"* is a classic error; the past lives **inside** the adjective:
*takakatta desu*.

**Irregular:** *ii* (good) conjugates from its older form *yoi* → *yokunai* (not good),
**yokatta** (was good — also the everyday expression for "oh good! / what a relief"),
*yokunakatta*.

### Type 2: *na*-adjectives (behave like nouns)

*kirei* (pretty/clean), *shizuka* (quiet), *nigiyaka* (lively), *benri* (convenient),
*yuumei* (famous), *genki* (healthy/energetic), *suki* (liked), *kirai* (disliked),
*daijoubu* (fine), *taihen* (tough), *hima* (free/not busy), *anzen* (safe).

They inflect exactly like nouns — the ending sits on *desu*, not on the word:

| Form | Example (*shizuka*) |
|------|---------------------|
| Present | *shizuka desu* — it's quiet |
| Negative | *shizuka ja nai desu* (or *ja arimasen*) |
| Past | *shizuka deshita* |
| Past negative | *shizuka ja nakatta desu* |

The name comes from what happens **before a noun**: they need **な** *na* as glue.

| Type | Before a noun |
|------|---------------|
| *i*-adjective | *takai hoteru* — an expensive hotel |
| *na*-adjective | *shizuka **na** hoteru* — a quiet hotel |

**Trap:** *kirei*, *yuumei* and *kirai* end in -i but are ***na*-adjectives**. Say *kirei
**na** hana* (a pretty flower) and *kirei deshita* (it was pretty), never *"kireikatta"*.

### Making things stronger or weaker

| Word | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| *totemo* | very | *totemo oishii desu* |
| *chotto / sukoshi* | a little | *chotto takai desu* — a bit pricey |
| *amari … -nai* | not very | *amari oishikunai desu* |
| *zenzen … -nai* | not at all | *zenzen wakarimasen* |
| *motto* | more | *motto ookii no* — a bigger one |
| *ichiban* | most / -est | *ichiban yasui no* — the cheapest one |

*amari* and *zenzen* **require a negative** later in the sentence — they're two halves of
one construction.

### Turning adjectives into adverbs

| Type | Rule | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| *i*-adj | -i → **-ku** | *hayai* (fast) → *hayaku* — *hayaku onegai shimasu* (quickly, please) |
| *na*-adj | + **ni** | *kirei* → *kirei ni* — *kirei ni narimashita* (it became clean) |

### Shopping shortcut: *no* = "one"

Instead of repeating the noun, use **の** *no* as "one":

*Motto yasui **no** wa arimasu ka* — "Do you have a cheaper **one**?"
*Chiisai **no** o kudasai* — "The small **one**, please."
*Akai **no** ga ii desu* — "I'd like the red **one**."

This one trick makes shopping conversations dramatically easier.

Two errors in the original:

2. Before a noun, na-adjectives need **な**: *kirei **na** hoteru*.

      id: "verb-groups",
      title: "Verb Shapes: Three Groups, No Person Agreement",
      body: `## The good news first

Japanese verbs **do not change for person or number**. There is no I/you/he-she-it
agreement, no singular/plural. *Tabemasu* means "I eat", "you eat", "they eat", "we will
eat" — context decides.

What verbs *do* change for is **tense, negation, politeness, and mood** — all by swapping
the ending.

### Dictionary form vs polite form

Every verb has a **dictionary form** (what you'd look up: *taberu*, *nomu*, *iku*) and a
**polite form** ending in **-masu** (*tabemasu*, *nomimasu*, *ikimasu*). As a tourist you
speak the *-masu* form, but you need the dictionary form to know **which group** a verb
belongs to — and the group determines every other transformation.

### Group 2 (*ru*-verbs) — the easy ones

End in **-eru** or **-iru**. Drop **ru**, add the ending.

| Dictionary | Polite | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| *taberu* | *tabemasu* | eat |
| *miru* | *mimasu* | see, watch |
| *okiru* | *okimasu* | get up |
| *neru* | *nemasu* | sleep |
| *dekiru* | *dekimasu* | can do |

### Group 1 (*u*-verbs) — the big group

Everything else ending in *-u*. The final *u* becomes *i*, then add *masu*:
*nomu → nomi + masu*.

| Dictionary | Polite | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| *nomu* | *nomimasu* | drink |
| *iku* | *ikimasu* | go |
| *kau* | *kaimasu* | buy |
| *matsu* | *machimasu* | wait |
| *hanasu* | *hanashimasu* | speak |
| *wakaru* | *wakarimasu* | understand |
| *aru* | *arimasu* | exist (things) |
| *kaeru* | *kaerimasu* | return home |

**Warning:** some verbs *look* like Group 2 but are Group 1 — *kaeru* (return), *hairu*
(enter), *hashiru* (run), *shiru* (know), *kiru* (cut). You just memorise these few.

### Group 3 — exactly two irregular verbs

| Dictionary | Polite | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| *suru* | *shimasu* | do |
| *kuru* | *kimasu* | come |

That's the entire irregular verb list. Compare English's hundreds. *suru* is the important
one, because it verbs any noun (*yoyaku shimasu*, *chekku-in shimasu*).

### The 25 verbs that cover a trip

| Verb (polite) | Meaning | Verb (polite) | Meaning |
|---------------|---------|---------------|---------|
| *ikimasu* | go | *kimasu* | come |
| *kaerimasu* | go home/back | *arimasu* | there is (things) |
| *imasu* | there is (people) | *tabemasu* | eat |
| *nomimasu* | drink | *kaimasu* | buy |
| *mimasu* | see, watch | *kikimasu* | listen, ask |
| *hanashimasu* | speak | *wakarimasu* | understand |
| *shimasu* | do | *machimasu* | wait |
| *aimasu* | meet | *tsukaimasu* | use |
| *norimasu* | ride, board | *orimasu* | get off |
| *iremasu* | put in | *dashimasu* | take out, send |
| *moraimasu* | receive | *agemasu* | give |
| *shirimasu* | know | *sagashimasu* | look for |
| *tsukimasu* | arrive | | |

### Two verbs English speakers keep mixing up

- ***norimasu*** takes **に** *ni*, not *o*: *Densha **ni** norimasu* — "I board the train."
- ***aimasu*** (meet) also takes **に**: *Tomodachi **ni** aimasu* — "I meet a friend."

Some Japanese verbs simply come with a fixed particle that doesn't match the English one.
Learn the verb and its particle as a single unit: *… ni norimasu*, *… ni aimasu*,
*… ga wakarimasu*, *… ga dekimasu*.

          answer: 1,
          explanation: `*nomu* is a **Group 1 (u-verb)**: the final **u** becomes **i**, then *masu* is added → **nomimasu**. Same pattern: *kaku → kakimasu*, *hanasu → hanashimasu*, *matsu → machimasu* (the *tsu* row shifts to *chi*).`

        {
          question: "Why is *kaerimasu* (to return home) the polite form of *kaeru*, not *\"kaemasu\"*?",
          answer: `Because *kaeru* is a **Group 1 verb that disguises itself as Group 2**. It ends in *-eru*, which normally signals a *ru*-verb (drop *ru* → *kaemasu*), but it actually conjugates as a *u*-verb: *kaer-* + *i* + *masu* = **kaerimasu**.

The other common disguised Group 1 verbs are *hairu* (enter), *hashiru* (run), *shiru* (know), *kiru* (cut) and *iru* (need). There's no rule — this handful is simply memorised.`

          question: "Which sentence correctly says \"I'll take (board) the Yamanote line\"?",
          options: [
            "Yamanote-sen o norimasu",
            "Yamanote-sen ni norimasu",
            "Yamanote-sen de norimasu",
            "Yamanote-sen wa norimasu"
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explanation: `*norimasu* is one of the verbs with a fixed **に** *ni*: you "get onto" a vehicle. English uses a direct object ("take the train"), Japanese uses a destination-like particle. Its opposite, *orimasu* (get off), takes **を** *o*: *Shibuya de orimasu* / *densha o orimasu*.`
